# WAN-Network

This Network Diagram consists of:

•	Connects to the DHCP SERVER
•	AutoAssigns IP address to host devices using DHCP Server
•	There are no overlapping IP address ranges
•	Uses RIPv2 routing protocol
•	8 VLANS on each site for better network management and security
•	Centralized switches 
•	Multilayer and layer 3 Switches are included and configured to occupy the respected VLANS
•	Uses FastEthernet-Cables for faster connectivity
The network setup connects to a DHCP server, which automatically assigns IP addresses to host devices without any overlapping IP address ranges. It uses the RIPv2 routing protocol and features eight VLANs on each site to enhance network management and security. The design includes centralized switches, along with multilayer and Layer 3 switches that are configured to operate within their respective VLANs. FastEthernet cables are used throughout the network to ensure faster connectivity.
